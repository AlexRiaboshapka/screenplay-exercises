These exercises are part of the (Serenity Dojo)[http://www.serenity-dojo.com/] training program, and are designed to help developers and testers learn how to work with Serenity Screenplay on real-world applications.

## The problem domain

In this series of exercises, we will be building up a test suite for a real-world web site. Each tutorial will focus on implementing a particular test scenario. 

## Starting a tutorial

Each tutorial has two main branches, one for the starting point for the tutorial, and one for a sample solution. The format for the branch names uses a simple naming convention to identify the starting point and the sample solutions for each tutorial. For example, to start tutorial 1, check out the `start` branch like this:
```
$ git checkout screenplay-webdriver-part-1/start
```

And to see the solution for tutorial 1, use the solution branch:
```
$ git checkout screenplay-webdriver-part-1/solution
```

Go to the tutorial branch to see the step-by-step instructions for that tutorial.
